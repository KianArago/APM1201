# OKAE Stock Market Simulator

## Project Description

The OKAE Stock Market Simulator is an interactive Python application that simulates a stock market environment where users can view stock prices, invest in stocks, track a portfolio, and even view detailed candlestick charts for each stock. The simulation generates random stock price data for a predefined set of stocks and allows users to manage their investments, buy/sell stocks, and visualize stock price movements over time. 

This project demonstrates how to simulate stock market behavior, manage a user's portfolio, and use visualizations like bar charts and candlestick charts to analyze stock price data.

## Features

1. Simulate stock market prices for a set of stocks.
2. View current stock prices and choose stocks to invest in.
3. Track a portfolio of investments and manage it (buy/sell stocks).
4. Sort stocks by price.
5. View detailed candlestick charts for each stock.
6. Real-time simulation of stock prices with periodic updates.
